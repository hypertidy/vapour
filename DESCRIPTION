Description: Provides low-level access to 'GDAL' functionality.  
  'GDAL' is the 'Geospatial Data Abstraction Library' a translator for raster and vector geospatial data formats 
  that presents a single raster abstract data model and single vector abstract data model to the calling application 
  for all supported formats <https://gdal.org/>. This package is focussed on providing exactly and only what GDAL does, to enable
  developing further tools.
